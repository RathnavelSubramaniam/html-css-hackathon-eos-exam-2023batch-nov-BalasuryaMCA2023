It is small crispy-flaky, puffy round bread which adds a supreme crunch and unbeatable taste to chaat recipes like pani puri, dahi puri, masala puri etc. Pani puri ki puri is prepared with the dough of semolina, all-purpose flour, baking soda and water. This dough is rolled out thin and cut into small discs and then deep fried on the higher side of the flame. Golgappa puri can also be accompanied by a cup of tea as evening snacks.","datePublished":"2022-07-15","recipeCategory":"Breakfast-Snacks","keywords":"suji ke golgappe, puri of pani puri recipe, golgappa ki recipe, how make golgappa, golgappe ki recipe, how to make pani puri ki puri, pani puri ki puri, puri of pani puri, puri for pani puri, suji ke golgappe banane ki vidhi, golgappa puri, golgappa puri recipe, golgappe ki vidhi, suji ke golgappe banane ka tarika, suji ke golgappe ki recipe, pani puri ki puri kaise banate hain, pani puri ki puri banane ki recipe, suji ke golgappe recipe, golgappa recipe at home, recipe of golgappa puri, suji aur aate ke golgappe, recipe of pani puri ki puri, recipe for pani puri ki puri, pani puri ki puri recipe, pani puri ki puri kaise banaye, pani puri ki puri kaise banaen, golgappe ki puri, puri for gol gappa, fuchka, kolkata street food, street food of kolkata, kolkata famous street food, kolkata street food recipe, bengali street food, Indian street food, Bengali snack recipe, Indian snack recipe, durga puja recipes, durga puja food","recipeCuisine":"Indian","recipeYield":"50 Pieces","prepTime":"PT30M","totalTime":"PT60M","cookTime":"PT30M","aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingValue":"3.5","reviewCount":"2"},"recipeIngredient":["1 cup = 250 ml","\u00bd cup Semolina aka suji","1 tablespoon all-purpose Flour aka Maida","\u00bc teaspoon salt","\u215b teaspoon or 1 small pinch of Baking soda","3 tablespoons Water","Oil to deep fry the puris"],"recipeInstructions":["Take a mixing bowl and add \u00bd cup semolina into it.","Add 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, \u00bc teaspoon salt, a small pinch of baking soda into the bowl and mix all the dry ingredients.","Add the required amount of water in small portions slowly into the mixture and mix it nicely to make a soft dough. Knead the dough for 8-10 minutes so that the elasticity forms into the dough. Note:\u00a0 Make soft dough for the puri. Semolina soaks water and after resting time it will dry up to perfect consistency.","Cover the dough with a wet kitchen towel and let it rest for half an hour.","After half an hour again, knead the dough for 2 minutes and divide them into equal portions to make large chapati balls.","Put the chapati balls on a roller board. Roll out a thin large chapati with the help of a rolling pin. Cover the other dough ball with a wet cloth during that time.","Cut the chapati into small discs with the help of a cookie cutter or small bowl or lid of any proper-sized container.","Cover them with a wet cloth.","Put a pan on flame and allow it to become completely dry.

Once you put the hot oil on the puri, they will puff up. Then flip them with a slotted spoon after puffing up. Tip: Don\u2019t overcrowd the pan. Puris will not get cooked properly if you overcrowd them. Make sure space is there.","Once the puris turn golden, strain the puris from the oil and transfer them to a kitchen tissue-lined plate. The kitchen tissue will absorb the excess oil.","Let the pani puri ki puri cool down completely and then store them in an airtight container."],"nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"NA","fatContent":"NA"}}</script>

<p><b>Pani puri ki puri recipe aka golgappa puri recipe is one of the most essential components of many Chaat recipes</b>. It is small crispy-flaky, puffy round bread which adds a supreme crunch and unbeatable taste to <b>chaat recipes</b> like <b><i>pani puri, dahi puri, masala puri</i></b> etc. <b>Pani puri ki puri</b> is prepared with the dough of semolina, all-purpose flour, baking soda and water. This dough is rolled out thin and cut into small discs and then deep fried on the higher side of the flame. <b>Golgappa puri</b> can also be accompanied by a cup of tea as evening snacks.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>To make things easily accessible, nowadays <b>pani puri ki puri</b> is easily available in the market not only in India but also in foreign countries. I stay in London and <b>golgappa puri</b> is available in many Gujarati snacks shop. There are two different varieties of puri is available on market. One is the non-fried dry puri packets which you need to fry in hot oil and another is the ready-to-eat fried packet of puffed puris. Now, you can imagine the immense popularity of <b>Indian Street Food</b> worldwide.</p>
<p><b>Though pani puri ki puri</b> is readily available in the market but I always prefer homemade <b>puri of pani puri</b> over market packaged food. It tastes exactly like market-bought ones and even it is much healthier than readymade ones. The palm oil which is used in readymade puri is not very good for health. Though a small effort would be required to prepare <b>golgappe ki puri</b> at home, but it will be thousand times healthier and tastier. You can easily see the difference after making it at home. From kids to aged people, everyone in the house loves Chaat and if your minimal effort makes your chaat healthy for your family then nothing can be better than it.</p>
<p><b>Golgappe ki puri is a wonderful option of Indian snacks recipes for the evening</b>. A cup of tea with some crispy and flaky puri makes the tea more interesting and delicious. Many people think that making <b>pani puri ki puri</b> at home is a very complicated and messy process, but I believe that’s not correct. The main thing you need to prepare <b>golgappa puri</b> at home is time. If you have time, then it is always fun to make puri at home.</p>
<p><b>Pani puri ki puri recipe</b> is very simple and easy to make. It requires minimal ingredients to get prepared. The best part is you can store it in an airtight container and use it afterwards. It will be an asset for your evening snacks. It can be prepared in both ways, by deep frying or baking. For baking <b>puri of panipuri</b>, the addition of baking soda is a must. Deep-fried <b>golgappa puri</b> always tastes better than the baked version. Today, I will share the deep-fried <b>suji ke golgappe ki recipe</b> with you.</p>
<p><b>Whenever I talk about pani puri ki puri recipe</b>, it always makes me feel nostalgic. It always reminds me of my school and college days. During those days, it was almost compulsory to have <b>panipuri</b> with friends every day on the way back from college or tutorial class. We used to devour those spherical divines with immense pleasure and a lot of chit-chat. Those were so fantastic days!!!</p>
<p>But after leaving India, I used to crave for <b>Indian street food</b>. Though there are few Indian street food stalls in London where panipuri is available, but it is not always possible to go so far for the snack. Even now, whenever I go to India, I always visit street food stalls and have those <b>street foods of India</b> to satisfy my craving and to give a throwback to the memories of school &amp; college days.</p>

</span></b> <b><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Tips to prepare perfect pani puri ki puri</span></b></header>
<ul>
<li>To prepare the perfect <b>puri for pani puri</b> please follow the measurement.</li>
<li>To get the perfect crisp of puri, it is very necessary to knead the dough properly. Knead it for at least 8-10 minutes.</li>
<li>Always mix the baking soda properly with semolina before adding water. The addition of baking soda helps the puri to puff up properly.</li>
<li>The dough has to be neither too dry nor too soft. It should be moderate. Semolina soaks water a lot. So, make the dough soft initially. Later it will soak water and turn tight after resting.</li>
<li>It is very important to rest the dough for 30 minutes. Cover the dough with a wet cloth and allow it to rest.</li>
<li>Roll the dough as thin as possible. If it is thick then it won&#8217;t taste good and may not puff up.</li>
<li>Try to roll the dough even for the perfect texture.</li>
<li>During the time of frying the puri, cover the rest of the dough and the shaped puris with a wet cloth. If the puri turns dry then it won’t puff up properly during drying.</li>
<li>Always fry the puri on medium-high flame. If you fry it over low flame, it will soak oil and turn soft in texture.</li>
<li>Don’t overcrowd the pan during the time of frying the puri.</li>

</span></b> <b><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; line-height: 107%;">How to make pani puri ki puri?</span></b></header>
<p><b>For the golgappa puris</b>, first, prepare the dough. I have used semolina, all-purpose flour, salt, baking soda and the required amount of water. Many people use Atta (wheat Flour) instead of Maida (all-purpose flour) for health consciousness. It’s completely your own preference. Semolina plays a vital role here. It helps to keep the puri crispy.</p>
<p>After adding the water, knead the dough properly for 8-10 minutes so elasticity forms in the dough. Then cover the dough with a wet cloth and allow it to rest for half an hour.</p>
<p><b>For a perfect pani puri ki puri recipe</b>, it is very important to prepare a perfect dough for it. The dough for puri should be neither too dry nor too soft. Semolina soaks water a lot. So make the dough soft initially. Later after resting time, it will soak water and turns tight after resting.</p>
<p><b>To make pani puri ki puri recipe</b>, make medium size balls of the dough with the help of your hands and flattened them. Then roll out the dough ball to a thin large chapati on a chapati board with a rolling pin. Don’t roll the dough thick or else puri will not puff up and may turn soft.</p>
<p>Then cut them into small discs with the help of a cookie cutter. You can also use a small bowl or a narrow-necked glass instead of a cookie cutter. You can roll small chapatis too instead of it. But this process would be too lengthy and time-consuming. I always prefer to roll large chapatis and then cut them into smaller discs. With this process, the puris remain even in shape.</p>
<p>The temperature of oil is an important factor during the time of frying puri. To get the perfect texture, it is very important to fry them at medium-high temperature. Don’t fry them over low flame then it will soak too much oil and may not puff up.</p>
<p>After frying the <b>golgappa puri</b>, stain them nicely and transfer them on a tissue-lined plate.</p>

					<h3 class="penci-recipe-title">Ingredients</h3>
											<p>1 cup = 250 ml</p>
<ul>
<li>½ cup Semolina aka suji</li>
<li>1 tablespoon all-purpose Flour aka Maida</li>
<li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
<li>⅛ teaspoon or 1 small pinch of Baking soda</li>
<li>3 tablespoons Water</li>
<li>Oil to deep fry the puris</li>
</ul>
									</div>
			
							<div class="penci-recipe-method">
					<h3 class="penci-recipe-title">Instructions</h3>
					<ol>
<li>Take a mixing bowl and add ½ cup semolina into it.</li>
<li>Add 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, ¼ teaspoon salt, a small pinch of baking soda into the bowl and mix all the dry ingredients.</li>
<li>Add the required amount of water in small portions slowly into the mixture and mix it nicely to make a soft dough. Knead the dough for 8-10 minutes so that the elasticity forms into the dough. <strong>Note:  </strong>Make soft dough for the puri. Semolina soaks water and after resting time it will dry up to perfect consistency.</li>
<li>Cover the dough with a wet kitchen towel and let it rest for half an hour.</li>
<li>After half an hour again, knead the dough for 2 minutes and divide them into equal portions to make large chapati balls.</li>
<li>Put the chapati balls on a roller board. Roll out a thin large chapati with the help of a rolling pin. Cover the other dough ball with a wet cloth during that time.</li>
<li>Cut the chapati into small discs with the help of a cookie cutter or small bowl or lid of any proper-sized container.</li>
<li>Cover them with a wet cloth.</li>
<li>Put a pan on flame and allow it to become completely dry. Add oil into a pan for deep frying the <strong>pani puri ki puri</strong>.</li>
<li>Once the oil is hot, turn the flame to medium-high and slide the puris carefully into the pan and fry them. Once you put the hot oil on the puri, they will puff up. Then flip them with a slotted spoon after puffing up. <strong>Tip:</strong> Don’t overcrowd the pan. Puris will not get cooked properly if you overcrowd them. Make sure space is there.</li>
<li>Once the puris turn golden, strain the puris from the oil and transfer them to a kitchen tissue-lined plate. The kitchen tissue will absorb the excess oil.</li>
<li>Let the <strong>pani puri ki puri</strong> cool down completely and then store them in an airtight container.</li>
</ol>
