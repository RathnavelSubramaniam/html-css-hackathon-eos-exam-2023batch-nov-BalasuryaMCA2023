Fail-proof barotta recipe

Easy Parotta recipe

I love Parotta and it is one recipe I have made many times in the past and there are many different parotta varieties on my blog too. But I never got around making the traditional parotta recipe and I had a great time clicking pictures while the husband took over the preparations.

Parotta is a layered flatbread popular in Tamilnadu and Kerala, traditionally made using maida (all-purpose flour). Working with maida and bringing out all the layers while keeping it soft is a tricky process. It involves a lot of elbow grease and the husband happily indulged me by taking over the whole recipe.
